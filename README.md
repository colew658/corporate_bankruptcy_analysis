While Eastern Europe is not the first place most people look to when they think of emerging economies, Poland has been a true economic success story over the past two decades. In fact, Poland was upgraded from Emerging Market to Developed Market status by FTSE Russell in 2018 (GPW). This comes just twenty years after Poland's entry onto the world economic stage with a GDP per capita that was only a quarter of the EU average (Fitzpatrick). Poland is now the 21st largest economy in the world, with strong GDP growth year over year that is far outpacing most other developed nations (Silver). This has not come without growing pains, though, and many Polish businesses have had to file for bankruptcy during this time of economic flourishing. The purpose of this analysis is to predict when a company will go bankrupt based on a variety of financial measures. The data for this analysis was collected from the Emerging Markets Information Service and includes five years of economic forecasting on a total of 43,405 companies, with the response being whether or not the company went bankrupt within the forecasting period. There are 64 predictors in the datasets, all of them describing different aspects of each business' finances. Using this data, I created a variety of statistical models to predict whether a company would go bankrupt within the forecasting period.
